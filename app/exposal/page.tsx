      <p style={{ display: shanyaDefendShow ? "" : "none" }} className="select">I mean at the end of the day it&apos;s not the word it&apos;s what it represents. Racism. Can you really say someone is racist if they don&apos;t.. well defend their positoin? A racist says it, and doubles down and says it twice when you call them out for it. Words enter out vocabulary though, and sometimes we just say retarded shit and there isn&apos;t any thought or ideology   put behind it or any real meaning - that&apos;s not the people who should be getting chastised, it&apos;s the first group of people that should. I&apos;m not a racist, I know myself, I know my intentions. I can spell the word out: nigger. That changes nothing about my actual beliefs for simply typing a sequence of characters. Words are just sounds, it&apos;s their meaning that matters, and their meaning doesn&apos;t exist in a vacuum. &quot;Big&quot; has a meaning, but you can&apos;t just take that word in a vacuum and judge it. &quot;Big mountain&quot; provides more context, but still can&apos;t be judged in a vacuum, what is there to judge? &quot;I hate big mountains&quot; now there&apos;s a subject, &quot;I&quot;, and more context, specifically to hate. Now you have enough to actually make some kind of judgement, like &quot;I disagree&quot;, but, you can&apos;t disagree with the word &quot;big&quot; or the words &quot;big mountain&quot;. Racism is  something to be disagreed with, it&apos;s a way of thinking, a point of view, a perspective. The word itself doesn&apos;t create that context, it&apos;s associated with it, just like &quot;voltage&quot;  is associated with &quot;electricity&quot; - cancelling people for using a word without actually considering the intent, the perspective they hold, disregarding whether or not they actually are racist or not and just focusing on the word itself is sadly all too common on the internet, to the point where even I censor myself most of the time in order not to piss of an algorithm or TOS that doesn&apos;t take any of what I said into account.</p>
